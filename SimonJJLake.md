1) Interest of Content
========
Score: Outstanding
--------

Content is well-written and interesting, particularly the page on linguistics.
Quotes are correctly cited and links being provided for external sources of information

2) Consistency and quality of visual presentation
=========
Score: Very good
---------

Visual style is clean and consistent, and the use of embedded videos on the robotics page benefits the visual
presentation. However, navigation through the site is lacking, with only the index page containing links
to other pages, and no way to return to the index from the other pages within the website itself.
