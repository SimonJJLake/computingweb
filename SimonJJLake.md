# 1) Interest of Content

## Score: Outstanding

Content is well-written and interesting, particularly the page on linguistics.

# 2) Consistency and quality of visual presentation

## Score: Good

Visual style is clean and mostly consistent (header at top changes in size between pages, size of images varies 
greatly between pages), and the use of embedded videos on the robotics page benefits the visual
presentation (Though they do appear significantly stretched out on the page). However, navigation through the site is lacking, with only the index page containing links
to other pages, and no way to return to the index from the other pages within the website itself.

# 3) Quality of written presentation

## Score: Excellent

Content is neatly formatted and easy to read, with varied approaches to presenting information (lists, links within the page) keeping the appearence of the text interesting. 
Only spotted one spelling mistake in the entire site, and no grammatical errors.
Quotes are correctly cited and links being provided for external sources of information is a useful addition.

# 4) Validity of HTML

## Score: Exemplary

No issues found

# 5) Evidence of collaboration

## Score: Very Good

### Author info not written by author

Where found, author info was not written by the author of the content. However, author info is missing on two of the pages

### Balanced contributions from members

While the majority of the site is consistent in amount of content, the bioinformatics page seems to be comparatively lacking. In addition, the number of commits provided by each group member shares a similar pattern

### Not completed at the last minute

While changes had been made the day prior to the due date, changes had been regular throughout the week so it is clear that overall this was not a last-minute attempt
