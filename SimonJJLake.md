1) Interest of Content
========

Score: Outstanding
--------

Content is well-written and interesting, particularly the page on linguistics.
Quotes are correctly cited and links being provided for external sources of information is a useful addition

2) Consistency and quality of visual presentation
=========

Score: Good
---------

Visual style is clean and mostly consistent (header at top changes in size between pages, size of images varies 
greatly between pages), and the use of embedded videos on the robotics page benefits the visual
presentation (Though they do appear significantly stretched out on the page). However, navigation through the site is lacking, with only the index page containing links
to other pages, and no way to return to the index from the other pages within the website itself.
